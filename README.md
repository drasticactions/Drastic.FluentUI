# Drastic.FluentUI

Drastic.FluentUI is an experimental bindings of [fluentui-apple](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-apple), Microsoft's FluentUI Library for Apple operating systems. These bindings are based off of a [fork](https://github.com/drasticactions/fluentui-apple) I've created, turning the static library into a framework, for easy binding.

At the moment, the goal is to show this as a proof of concept. The API bindings and names need work, but they should function.
